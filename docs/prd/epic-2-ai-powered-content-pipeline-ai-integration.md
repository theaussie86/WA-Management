# Epic 2: AI-Powered Content Pipeline (AI Integration)

**Epic Goal**: Add AI automation while preserving manual fallbacks and establishing human-in-the-loop workflows.

**Value Delivered**: AI-assisted content generation with human oversight and approval workflows.

**Duration**: 3-4 sprints

**Integration Requirements**: Integrate n8n workflows and AI services while maintaining all Epic 1 functionality as fallbacks.

## Story 2.1: Research API Integration and External Service Setup

As a content automation system,
I want to integrate with research APIs and external services,
so that automated trend research and content ideation can access real-time data sources.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Google Trends API account setup and authentication configuration
2. News API service selection, account creation, and integration setup
3. Research API rate limit and quota management strategies implemented
4. API key secure storage and rotation procedures established
5. Research service fallback mechanisms for API unavailability
6. Development mock responses for offline research API testing
7. Research API cost monitoring and usage tracking implementation

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Research APIs integrate properly with self-hosted n8n workflows
- **IV2**: API rate limits and quotas properly managed to prevent service disruption
- **IV3**: Fallback mechanisms provide graceful degradation during API outages
- **IV4**: Development environment functions without external API dependencies

## Story 2.2: n8n Workflow Integration and Webhook System

As a content automation system,
I want to integrate with n8n workflows for background AI processing,
so that research, ideation, and content generation can happen automatically.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Webhook endpoints created for n8n workflow results (trends, ideas, drafts, creatives)
2. n8n workflow triggers initiated based on campaign context and scheduling
3. Error handling and retry mechanisms for failed workflow executions
4. Workflow status tracking and logging for troubleshooting
5. Secure webhook authentication and data validation
6. Self-hosted n8n workflow deployment strategy documented and coordinated with app deployments
7. Environment variable synchronization between Next.js app and self-hosted n8n instance
8. Webhook endpoint versioning strategy for workflow updates

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Webhook endpoints integrate properly with existing Next.js API routes
- **IV2**: Database transactions handle n8n workflow results reliably
- **IV3**: Error scenarios gracefully degrade to manual workflows
- **IV4**: Self-hosted n8n instance maintains reliable connectivity and workflow execution
- **IV5**: Deployment coordination ensures workflow and app version compatibility

## Story 2.3: AI Content Generation and Review Interface

As a content creator,
I want to review and approve AI-generated content suggestions,
so that I maintain quality control while benefiting from automated content generation.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. AI content suggestion interface with approve/reject/customize options
2. Content ideation approval screen with campaign context display
3. Draft editor with side-by-side AI content and human editing capabilities
4. Creative asset gallery with visual approval workflow
5. Batch approval options for efficient workflow management

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Content approval updates propagate correctly through Supabase real-time
- **IV2**: Editor interface maintains usability across different content types
- **IV3**: AI workflows fall back to manual creation when services unavailable

## Story 2.4: Content Pipeline Dashboard with Real-time Updates

As a content automation user,
I want a centralized dashboard showing my content pipeline status,
so that I can efficiently manage AI-generated content review and approval workflows.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard displays AI-generated content pending review
2. Content pipeline visualization shows items at each stage (research → ideation → drafting → creative → queued)
3. Quick action cards for approve, reject, edit operations
4. Real-time updates when n8n workflows complete background tasks
5. Campaign context selector affects all dashboard content

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Real-time Supabase subscriptions update dashboard without page refresh
- **IV2**: Dashboard performance remains responsive with AI-generated content volume
- **IV3**: Mobile-responsive design works across different screen sizes
