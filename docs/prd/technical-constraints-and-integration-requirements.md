# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack
**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript
**Frameworks**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19
**Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Real-time subscriptions
**Infrastructure**: Vercel deployment, Edge Functions
**External Dependencies**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React icons

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**:
- Design new content pipeline tables in Supabase optimized for automation workflow
- Utilize Supabase Real-time for live content pipeline status updates
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) for campaign and content access control
- Store AI-generated content, human edits, and workflow states in structured format

**API Integration Strategy**:
- n8n workflows communicate with Supabase via REST API and webhooks
- AI services integrated through n8n workflows to centralize external API management
- LinkedIn API integration for publishing and analytics data retrieval
- Internal API routes in Next.js for content approval and campaign management

**Frontend Integration Strategy**:
- Server Components for content display and static campaign data
- Client Components for interactive approval interfaces and real-time updates
- Custom hooks for content pipeline state management
- Supabase client-side subscriptions for live workflow updates

**Testing Integration Strategy**:
- Jest and React Testing Library for component and workflow testing
- Mock n8n webhook endpoints for development and testing
- Supabase local development environment for database testing
- Integration tests for AI service mock responses

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
```

│   ├── campaigns/           # Campaign management pages
│   ├── content/            # Content pipeline interfaces
│   │   ├── review/         # Content review workflows
│   │   ├── editor/         # Draft editing interface
│   │   └── publish/        # Publishing interface

├── content/                # Content-specific components
│   ├── pipeline-status.tsx
│   ├── content-card.tsx
│   └── approval-buttons.tsx
├── campaigns/              # Campaign management components
└── ui/                     # shadcn/ui components

├── supabase/              # Database operations
├── n8n-webhooks/          # n8n integration handlers

└── linkedin-api/          # LinkedIn API integration
```

**Naming Conventions**:
- TypeScript interfaces: `ContentPipelineItem`, `CampaignContext`, `AIGeneratedContent`
- Database tables: `campaigns`, `content_items`, `pipeline_status`, `ai_generations`
- API routes: `/api/content/approve`, `/api/campaigns/switch`, `/api/n8n/webhook`

**Coding Standards**:
- Strict TypeScript configuration with explicit types for all functions
- Server Components by default, Client Components only for interactivity
- Custom hooks for reusable content pipeline logic
- Error boundaries for AI service failures and n8n workflow errors

**Documentation Standards**:
- JSDoc comments for all AI integration functions
- README documentation for n8n workflow setup
- API documentation for webhook endpoints
- Database schema documentation with relationship diagrams

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**:
- No modifications to existing Next.js build process
- Environment variables for AI service API keys and n8n webhook URLs
- Type checking integration with existing TypeScript setup
- Database migrations through Supabase CLI integration

**Deployment Strategy**:
- Vercel deployment unchanged, new API routes automatically deployed
- Environment variable management for AI services and n8n integration
- Database schema updates through Supabase migrations
- n8n workflows deployed separately but integrated via webhooks

**Monitoring and Logging**:
- Supabase logging for content pipeline operations
- Vercel function logs for API route monitoring
- n8n workflow execution logs for automation troubleshooting
- AI service usage tracking for cost optimization

**Configuration Management**:
- Campaign configuration stored in Supabase for dynamic updates
- AI service prompts and templates in database for easy modification
- n8n workflow configuration externalized for non-technical adjustments
- Feature flags for gradual rollout of automation features

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- AI service rate limits and cost overruns
- n8n workflow failures disrupting content pipeline
- LinkedIn API changes affecting publishing functionality
- Supabase performance with high-frequency AI content generation

**Integration Risks**:
- Webhook reliability between n8n and Supabase
- AI service quality consistency across different content types
- Real-time updates overwhelming frontend performance
- Campaign context switching causing data inconsistencies

**Deployment Risks**:
- Environment variable misconfiguration breaking AI integrations
- Database migration failures with content pipeline data
- n8n workflow deployment synchronization with app deployment
- Vercel function timeout limits with AI content generation

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement circuit breakers for AI service failures with graceful degradation
- Queue-based architecture for n8n workflows with retry mechanisms
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly fallback interfaces
- Staged deployment approach with feature flags for safe rollouts
- Database backup strategy before schema changes for content data
- AI service cost monitoring with usage caps and alerts
