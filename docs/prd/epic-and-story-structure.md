# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Value-driven three-epic approach for LinkedIn AI-powered content automation system.

**Rationale**: After comprehensive analysis, a three-epic structure provides optimal value delivery, risk management, and user feedback integration. This approach enables early value delivery while maintaining system coherence and allows for iterative refinement based on user feedback at each milestone.

**Benefits of Multi-Epic Approach**:
- **Early Value Delivery**: Working content management system after Epic 1
- **Reduced Development Risk**: Smaller scope per epic reduces failure probability
- **User Feedback Integration**: Early user validation guides subsequent epic development
- **Flexible Scope Management**: System provides value even if later epics are deferred
- **Better Dependency Management**: Clear milestone gates with defined deliverables
- **Brownfield Safety**: Each epic thoroughly tested before next epic begins

## Value Delivery Timeline

**Epic 1 (Sprint 2-3)**: Manual content management foundation
**Epic 2 (Sprint 5-6)**: AI-powered content generation with human oversight
**Epic 3 (Sprint 7-9)**: Complete automation with LinkedIn publishing and analytics
