# Epic 1: Content Foundation & Campaign Management (MVP Foundation)

**Epic Goal**: Establish secure foundation and enable manual content management with campaign context.

**Value Delivered**: Users can create campaigns, manage content manually, and establish content approval workflows.

**Duration**: 2-3 sprints

**Integration Requirements**: Build foundational data models and campaign management on existing architectural foundation while preserving all existing functionality.

## Story 1.0: Testing Infrastructure & Development Environment Setup

As a development team,
I want comprehensive testing infrastructure established,
so that all subsequent stories can be developed with proper test coverage and quality assurance.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Jest and React Testing Library configured for component testing
2. Supabase local development environment setup for database testing
3. Mock n8n webhook endpoints configured for development and testing
4. Test database seeding and cleanup utilities created
5. Integration test framework for AI service mock responses
6. CI/CD pipeline updated to run tests before deployment
7. Self-hosted n8n instance connection and webhook configuration for development

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Test suite runs successfully in local and CI environments
- **IV2**: Mock services provide realistic responses for development
- **IV3**: Database testing doesn't interfere with production data
- **IV4**: Self-hosted n8n instance properly configured for development workflows

## Story 1.1: Foundation Data Models and Authentication Integration

As a content management system user,
I want secure access to campaign and content data,
so that I can manage content workflows within the existing WA Management App.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Database schema created for campaigns, content_items, content_versions, and workflow_executions tables
2. Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented for content and campaign access control
3. Authentication integration maintains existing user system functionality
4. Database relationships optimized for content management queries
5. Basic API endpoints for campaigns and content CRUD operations

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Existing authentication system continues to function without disruption
- **IV2**: Database performance remains stable with new content management tables
- **IV3**: Vercel deployment process unaffected by new database schema

## Story 1.2: Campaign Management System

As a LinkedIn content creator,
I want to create and manage multiple campaign contexts,
so that I can organize content for different audiences and messaging strategies.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Campaign creation wizard with target audience, messaging tone, and content theme definition
2. Campaign list and management interface with edit/delete capabilities
3. Campaign context selector for filtering content by campaign
4. Campaign template management for saved messaging guidelines
5. Campaign settings and preferences persist across user sessions

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Campaign data storage integrates properly with Supabase real-time features
- **IV2**: UI components follow established shadcn/ui design patterns
- **IV3**: Campaign context switching maintains performance under typical usage

## Story 1.3: Basic Content Creation Interface

As a content creator,
I want to manually create and manage content within campaign contexts,
so that I can organize and approve content before implementing automation.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Content creation form with title, description, and campaign assignment
2. Content editing interface with version history
3. Basic approval workflow (draft → review → approved)
4. Content list view filtered by campaign context
5. Simple content status tracking (draft, approved, published)

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Content creation integrates with campaign context switching
- **IV2**: Content versioning works correctly with database relationships
- **IV3**: Manual workflows provide foundation for future AI integration

## Story 1.4: User Onboarding & Knowledge Transfer

As a first-time user,
I want guided onboarding through campaign setup and AI workflow concepts,
so that I can effectively use the content automation system.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. First-time user onboarding flow for campaign creation with step-by-step guidance
2. Interactive tutorial for daily content review workflow with practice scenarios
3. Help documentation for AI concept explanation and human-in-the-loop principles
4. Deployment and operational knowledge documentation for system maintenance
5. Decision log system for tracking architectural changes and rationale
6. Code review and knowledge sharing processes established for team collaboration
7. User training materials including video guides for common workflows

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Onboarding flow integrates seamlessly with existing authentication system
- **IV2**: Help documentation accessible from all major workflow screens
- **IV3**: Training materials remain current with system updates
- **IV4**: Knowledge transfer documentation enables smooth team handoff
