# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall automatically research LinkedIn trends and industry topics via externally developed n8n workflows that access the Supabase database directly for human review and selection.

**FR2:** The system shall provide AI-generated content ideas based on campaign context, trending topics, and user's automation industry expertise.

**FR3:** The system shall generate draft LinkedIn posts using AI assistance while maintaining campaign-specific messaging and tone.

**FR4:** The system shall produce AI-generated creative assets (images, graphics) with human approval workflows integrated into the WA Management App interface.

**FR5:** The system shall support multiple LinkedIn campaign contexts allowing users to switch between different target audiences and messaging strategies.

**FR6:** The system shall provide human-in-the-loop decision points at key stages: trend selection, content ideation approval, draft review, and creative asset approval.

**FR7:** The system shall integrate with LinkedIn API for manual publishing initially, with architecture supporting future automation.

**FR8:** The system shall maintain content pipeline status tracking from research through publishing with clear workflow states.

**FR9:** The system shall store all AI-generated content, human edits, and campaign performance data in Supabase for learning and optimization.

**FR10:** The system shall provide a dashboard interface showing daily AI-researched trends, pending content for review, and campaign performance metrics.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The system must build upon existing WA Management App architectural foundation without disrupting core authentication and deployment infrastructure.

**NFR2:** AI content generation workflows must complete background processing within 15 minutes to support daily content creation schedules.

**NFR3:** The system must maintain responsive performance with content pipeline data, targeting sub-2 second load times for content review interfaces.

**NFR4:** All AI-generated content and human interactions must be securely stored with proper data encryption and access controls using Supabase security features.

**NFR5:** The human-in-the-loop interfaces must provide intuitive approval/rejection workflows that integrate seamlessly with the shadcn/ui design system.

**NFR6:** Externally developed n8n workflows must include proper error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure reliable background automation.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1:** The system must utilize existing WA Management App technical foundation (authentication framework, routing structure) while implementing the first major business functionality.

**CR2:** Database schema design has full flexibility since no business data models exist yet - optimize for LinkedIn content automation use case without legacy constraints.

**CR3:** UI components must follow established shadcn/ui design patterns and Tailwind CSS styling for consistency with architectural foundation.

**CR4:** The system must integrate with existing Vercel deployment pipeline and CI/CD processes without modifications to core build workflows.
