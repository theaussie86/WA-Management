# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI Foundation
The system will replace the template placeholder interface with a purpose-built LinkedIn content automation interface. The design will leverage the established shadcn/ui component library and Tailwind CSS framework while creating a completely new user experience optimized for content pipeline management.

**UI Design Approach:**
- **Content-First Interface**: Dashboard designed around daily content review and approval workflows
- **Campaign Context Switching**: Prominent campaign selector affecting all content generation and review
- **Pipeline Visualization**: Clear status tracking from research → ideation → drafting → creative → publishing
- **Human-in-the-Loop Decision Points**: Intuitive approval/rejection interfaces at key workflow stages

## Core Interface Components

### Content Pipeline Dashboard
- **Daily Content Overview**: AI-researched trends, pending reviews, scheduled posts
- **Campaign Context Selector**: Switch between different LinkedIn campaign strategies
- **Workflow Status Indicators**: Visual pipeline showing content at each stage
- **Quick Action Cards**: Approve, reject, edit, or publish content with single clicks

### Content Review Interfaces
- **Trend Review Screen**: AI-researched topics with approve/reject/customize options
- **Ideation Approval**: AI-generated content ideas with campaign context
- **Draft Editor**: Side-by-side AI draft and human editing interface
- **Creative Asset Gallery**: AI-generated visuals with approval workflow

### Campaign Management
- **Campaign Setup Wizard**: Define target audience, messaging tone, content themes
- **Campaign Performance Dashboard**: Content metrics per campaign context
- **Template Management**: Saved prompts and styles per campaign

## UI Consistency Requirements

**Design System Compliance:**
- All components use shadcn/ui base components for consistency
- Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling and responsive design
- Dark/light theme support across all new interfaces
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go content approval

**User Experience Principles:**
- **Minimize Cognitive Load**: Clear information hierarchy for content review decisions
- **Reduce Context Switching**: Campaign context persists across all interfaces
- **Streamline Approvals**: Single-click actions for common workflow decisions
- **Visual Content Preview**: Rich preview of posts and creatives before publishing
