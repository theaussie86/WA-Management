# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **WA - Management LinkedIn AI Content Automation System**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template Analysis

**Project Foundation**: This is a **brownfield enhancement** built on an existing Next.js 15 project with established architectural patterns:

- **Base Template**: Custom Next.js 15 application with App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict mode
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Supabase Backend-as-a-Service, Vercel deployment pipeline, shadcn/ui component system
- **Current State**: Complete technical foundation with authentication, but template UI needing replacement with content automation interface
- **Constraints**: Must preserve existing auth system, deployment workflow, and component library approach
- **Opportunity**: Clean slate for business logic and data models since no production content data exists

**Architectural Decision**: Leverage existing foundation while building the first major business feature (LinkedIn content automation) with complete UI redesign optimized for content pipeline management.
